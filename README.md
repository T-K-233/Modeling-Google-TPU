# Modeling Google TPU

This repository contains a best-effort functional model of Google TPU v5e-1.

The instructions are extracted from LLO compiler output, and the semantic meaning of each instruction is inferred from code context. As a result, correctness is **not guaranteed**. 

Comments, questions, corrections, and PRs are very welcomed!
